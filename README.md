## Hello there 👋

I'm Leonardo de Souza Melo, a Junior Backend Developer specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.

🔍 I work with systems that analyze **video streams and images** to learn patterns and behaviors, applying logic to solve real-world problems such as:
- People and object detection (tracking, counting, movement analysis)
- Behavior analysis from video data

This field offers a huge range of possibilities, and I'm especially interested in building backend solutions that connect AI models with real applications.
